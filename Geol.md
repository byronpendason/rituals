# Preparation
*Prepare your ritual space. I like to clean my altar immediately before ritual of any dust that might have collected on it since last use. You will also want to prepare your offerings.*

*Cleanse yourself to make yourself fit to appear before the gods. I will generally shower before ritual, and offer a prayer to the water to wash away ritual uncleanliness from me. Others simply wash their hands and their face. Do whatever feels right for your praxis.*

# Hallowing

*I think of the hallowing as serving two purposes. First, it banishes "baneful wights" whose intentions may not be in line with your own. Second, it ritually cleans the area so that it's fit for a visit from the gods. You can read about the ritual I use on my [blog post](https://www.minewyrtruman.com/2020/11/19/my-hallowing-ritual/) on the subject.*

> May the gods guide us,    
> May our oaths keep us,    
> May our deeds free us,    
> May our ancestors aid us always.    
>     
> May the gods banish from this place all ill and wrong,    
> Hallow this space, shield this area from all baneful wights,    
> Let the gods’ blessing be over our heads!

# Introduction

> I come to my altar to observe the beginning of Yule. Tonight is the longest night of the year, but the day will begin to get longer. We have reached the turning point of the year!

# Prayers

> Hail the *Ēse*, the gods who maintain the cosmic order. Winter is here, coldness pervades. But winter is a part of your order, so I thank you all for the part it plays in giving Mother Eorthe her rest. During her long sleep, her daughter Eostre wanders and sister Sunne searches for her. But winter won't last forever, Sunne shall find her sister and they shall return together too bring back summer.    
>    
> I thank you for the protection of my loved ones during the long nights, and I pray for your continued protection even as the days increase.
>    
> In thanks for your protection, I offer you this glass of mead. May you enjoy it.

*Pour the glass of mead into your offering bowl.*

> A gift has been given, may it be well received. A gift for a gift!

# Conclusion

> I thank the *Ēse* for their presence at my humble ritual. May we part in peace, and remain at peace until we meet again. So may it be!
